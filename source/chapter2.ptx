      <title>Basics and Modules for Matrix Algebra</title>
      <introduction>

      <p> In this chapter we will introduce just enough about Python to get started then introduce
        a Python package <c>NumPy</c> and a library <c>MatPlotLib</c> needed for mathematics and graphing. 
        Note that we will skip over a lot of information you would learn in a typical Computer Science <em>Introduction to Python</em> class. 
        Python is much more useful than you will see here, but our purpose is to get you familiar with the kinds of commands
        available in Python to compute matrix algebra.  
      </p> 
        
        
       <p> 
        To start, a traditional first program displays the text <c>Hello world.</c> or some variation. 
        Python uses the function <c> print() </c> to display output, making the program simple.
      </p>
      
      

      <sage language='python'>
        <input>
          print("Hello world!")
        </input>
      </sage>

      <p> Click the <q> evaluate </q> button above to run the embedded Python code. 
        Note that snippets of Python code embedded in the textbook will always have a similar formatting, with the option to <q>evaluate</q>, 
        that is <em>run</em>, the program at the end.
