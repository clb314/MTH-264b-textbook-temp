      <title>Matrix Algebra in Python</title>

      <introduction>

        <p> Now that we have learned some basics in NumPy and graphing in Matplotlib, 
          we are ready to dive into computations for matrix algebra. 
          In this chapter we will look at the traditional topics in MTH 264 Introduction to Matrix Algebra
          from a computational perspective, using Python to do the computations.
